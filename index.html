        Hi, my name is Doeun. Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet.
        One word I'd use to describe myself is <i>curious</i>. Learning and
        expanding the mind is my muse. In a world that moves ever so fast, I'm
        learning to slow down and feel the ground beneath my feet. Caffeine
        wires me in, but I find myself more often these days yearning for the
        organic focus that only good sleep can give me. I love electronic music,
        but the silence of the gym, with just my breathing and the metallic
        clanking of weights, is also beautiful. One of the earliest lessons of
        my twenties is that the more I try to control my life, the more I
        actually lose control of it. It's important to fight, but yielding is
        just as important.

        <br /><br />
