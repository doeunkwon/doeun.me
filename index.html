    ٩(＾◡＾)۶ <( hi! )
    <br><br>
    My name is Doeun, and I live in Vancouver, BC.
    <br><br>
    I'm currently a mathematics student at the University of British Columbia.
    I'm interested in algorithms and combinatorics. My favourite courses so far
    have been Basic Algorithms and Data Structures, Intermediate
    Algorithm Design and Analysis, Introduction to Discrete Mathematics,
    Mathematical Proof, and Applied Linear Algebra.
    <br><br>
    I have experience in iOS development. This winter, I'm hoping to share my
    first complete iOS project with the world. I appreciate this somewhat niche
    category of development because it comes with a set of unique challenges.
    In particular, I have to be thinking about algorithms, logic, constraints,
    design, user experience, and more. I think that these type of problems are
    fun to try and solve because they give me the opportunity to be creative.
    <br><br>
    I like to stay active. Running and weightlifting are integral parts of my
    lifestyle. More recently, I got into bouldering. I was surprised to realize
    that bouldering requires a lot of mental problem-solving. I think it's
    analogous to solving a computer science problem, where knowing how to code
    (or knowing how to climb) only does so little. Most of the problem-solving
    lies in designing a good solution.
