          I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I now live in Vancouver, BC. I'm a
          software developer with an interest in consumer products and
          marketing.
          <br><br>
          I'm drawn to algorithms and combinatorics. My favourite courses so
          far at UBC have been Basic Algorithms and Data Structures, Intermediate
          Algorithm Design and Analysis, Introduction to Discrete Mathematics,
          Mathematical Proof, and Applied Linear Algebra.

          This past summer of 2022, I
          worked as an iOS developer at <a href="https://later.com/">Later</a>.
          During my time here, I learned how to build robust software from
          talented engineers. I appreciate this niche category of
          development because it comes with a set of unique challenges. In
          particular, I have to be thinking about algorithms, logic,
          constraints, design, user experience, and more. These
          types of problems are fun to tackle because they demand
          creativity.

          Running and weightlifting are integral parts of
          my lifestyle. More recently, I got into bouldering. I was surprised to
          realize that bouldering requires a lot of mental problem-solving. I
          think it's analogous to solving a computer science problem, where
          knowing how to code (or knowing how to climb) only goes so far. Most
          of the problem-solving lies in designing a good solution.
