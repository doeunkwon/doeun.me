          Computer science is the <i>science of computing</i> - a study that
          goes beyond the realm of electronic computers. This field of study
          fascinates me, not because I like computers, but because I like to
          problem-solve. My favourite topics in mathematics are algorithms and
          combinatorics because I think counting, or computing, is useful.
          Through counting, we’re able to quantify, compare, and analyze many
          important things. But counting solves just a small chunk of all
          problems.

          There are problems that <i>probably</i> can’t be solved through
          computation and I find that interesting. I’m curious about human
          interactions and experiences. Chairs, raves, plants, and movies are
          just a few things that interact with humans. If an interaction is a
          problem instance, then the experience is a proposed solution. To solve
          the problem is to orchestrate an experience that influences people in
          a way that is intended by the orchestrator. One solution that I’m
          interested in comes in the form of software products. I aspire to
          create new experiences for people using my mind and hands.

          As per the unnecessarily big letters above, my name is Doeun and I’m a
          software developer.
