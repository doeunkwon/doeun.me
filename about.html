          Hi, I'm Doeun. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and I currently live
          in Vancouver, BC. I'm an aspiring software developer with an interest
          in consumer products.
          <br><br>
          I'm currently working towards my undergraduate degree in mathematics
          at the University of British Columbia. I enjoy learning about
          algorithms and combinatorics. My favourite courses so far have been
          Basic Algorithms and Data Structures, Intermediate Algorithm Design
          and Analysis, Introduction to Discrete Mathematics, Mathematical
          Proof, and Applied Linear Algebra.
          <br><br>
          I have experience in developing software. This past summer of 2022, I
          worked as an iOS developer at <a href="https://later.com/">Later</a>.
          During my time here, I learned how to build robust software from very
          talented engineers. I appreciate this somewhat niche category of
          development because it comes with a set of unique challenges. In
          particular, I have to be thinking about algorithms, logic,
          constraints, design, user experience, and more. I think that these
          type of problems are fun to try and solve because they require
          creativity.
          <br><br>
          I like to stay active. Running and weightlifting are integral parts of
          my lifestyle. More recently, I got into bouldering. I was surprised to
          realize that bouldering requires a lot of mental problem-solving. I
          think it's analogous to solving a computer science problem, where
          knowing how to code (or knowing how to climb) only helps so much. Most
          of the problem-solving lies in designing a good solution.
