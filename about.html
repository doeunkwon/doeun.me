          I'm a software developer based in Vancouver, BC.
          <br><br>
          I'm fascinated by algorithms and combinatorics. My favourite courses so
          far at UBC have been Basic Algorithms and Data Structures, Intermediate
          Algorithm Design and Analysis, Introduction to Discrete Mathematics,
          Mathematical Proof, and Applied Linear Algebra.
          <br><br>
          This past summer of 2022, I
          worked as an iOS developer at <a href="https://later.com/">Later</a>.
          During my time here, I learned about product development and management.
          This experience sparked my interest in consumer products - specifically
          SaaS. I appreciate this industry because it comes with a set of unique challenges. In
          particular, I have to be thinking about algorithms, logic,
          constraints, design, user experience, and more. These
          types of problems are fun to tackle because they demand
          creativity.

          Running and weightlifting are integral parts of
          my lifestyle. More recently, I got into bouldering. I was surprised to
          realize that bouldering requires a lot of mental problem-solving. I
          think it's analogous to solving a computer science problem, where
          knowing how to code (or knowing how to climb) only goes so far. Most
          of the problem-solving lies in designing a good solution.
