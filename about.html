        <h2>Hey,</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Doeun. I was born in South Korea, and now I live in
          Vancouver, BC. I'm focused on building products that influence the way
          people live their day-to-day lives. I obsess over design because I'm a
          visual learner and good design has always had a big impact on me. I
          love working on new ideas, so if you'd like to team up, please don't
          hesitate to
