          Hi there. My name is Doeun. I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and
          I currently live in Vancouver, BC.
          <br><br>
          I'm currently working towards my undergraduate degree in mathematics
          at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in algorithms
          and combinatorics. My favourite courses so far have been Basic
          Algorithms and Data Structures, Intermediate Algorithm Design and
          Analysis, Introduction to Discrete Mathematics, Mathematical Proof,
          and Applied Linear Algebra.
          <br><br>
          I have experience in developing software. This past summer of 2022, I
          worked as an iOS developer at <a href="https://later.com/">Later</a>.
          During my time here, I learned a ton from talented engineers. This
          winter of 2022, I'm hoping to share my first complete iOS project with
          the world. I appreciate this somewhat niche category of development
          because it comes with a set of unique challenges. In particular, I
          have to be thinking about algorithms, logic, constraints, design, user
          experience, and more. I think that these type of problems are fun to
          try and solve because they require creativity.
          <br><br>
          I like to stay active. Running and weightlifting are integral parts of
          my lifestyle. More recently, I got into bouldering. I was surprised to
          realize that bouldering requires a lot of mental problem-solving. I
          think it's analogous to solving a computer science problem, where
          knowing how to code (or knowing how to climb) only helps so much. Most
          of the problem-solving lies in designing a good solution.
          <br><br>
